# Multi-Class-Prediction-of-Cirrhosis-Outcomes
Kaggle Competition Predictive Modeling and Data Analysis
Project Overview:
This Kaggle competition involved predicting multi-label outcomes for cirrhosis patients, using anonymized patient data with hidden feature meanings to ensure privacy. The challenge required a multi-class approach to forecast the potential outcomes for each patient, with the primary objective being to achieve high predictive accuracy on the leaderboard while also demonstrating creativity in approach and methodology.

Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies within the dataset, identifying possible “tricks” or unique challenges posed by the hidden features.

Multi-Class Modeling Techniques: Implemented various multi-class classification algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, optimizing each for multi-class logarithmic loss, the competition’s evaluation metric.

Probability Calibration: Focused on accurate probability predictions by calibrating model outputs to meet the requirements of the log-loss scoring, ensuring well-distributed probabilities for each potential outcome class.

Daily Iteration and Optimization: Utilized daily submission limits to iteratively test and refine models, adjusting feature selection, hyperparameters, and ensemble methods to enhance performance on both public and private leaderboards.

Skills Demonstrated:

Machine Learning for Health Data: Applied classification models to health data, handling feature ambiguity and privacy constraints with analytical rigor.
Probability and Logarithmic Loss Optimization: Focused on minimizing multi-class log loss by tuning probability outputs, demonstrating precision in probabilistic modeling.
Model Evaluation and Selection: Leveraged public and private leaderboard feedback to refine models, balancing performance with creative exploration of modeling techniques.
